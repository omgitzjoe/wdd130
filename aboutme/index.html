    <H2>This is Joe</H2>
    <p>I'm a computer science major, in my first semester.  I love playing games, doing puzzles, and watching shows. Most importantly, I am 
        married to my beautiful wife Jess, and we share 4 kids.  I'm here to get an education and hopefully some job security while raising my children.

    I was born and raised LDS, grew up in Utah. I am excited to be attending a school that shares the values I have learned growing up.
