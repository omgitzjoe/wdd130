      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This website is designed to attract Baltimore Ravens fans, both the veterans, and the newcomers. People will want to come to this site to see news updates about the football team, current standings, and very brief descriptions of prominent members of the team. Page one will be a current event type page, page two being a historical page, and page three being a future forecast for the team. Page one will be the most visually pleasing page as it is partly the hook to bring in and keep visitors. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent signings, scandals, trade rumours. All will be easily available here on the home page, for easy access. 
        Injury news or disciplinary action as well, to help out your fantasy sports team on who or whom not to play. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I intend to have a power rankings chart when closer to the season and one becomes available from espn.com or nfl.com. For now I will have a link to the website's final 2024 season rankings. https://www.espn.com/nfl/fpi and https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-power-rankings-super-bowl-2024-nfl-season 
        The site will have a preview to the next game which will have who, when, and where it will be playing.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        I intend to have the second page be a history based page. Dedicated to the past of the Ravens and the club’s history. There is a lot of culture and philosophy that define this team, and thus defines its fans. This will be the information that separates the newcomer fans and the old-timers, the Ravens for life fans.
</p><p>
Summary of culture, (what makes the Ravens, the Ravens).
A paragraph or two that best describes what gives this team its identity.  How they draft players, how they decide who to trade for. What areas of focus make this team different from others? How do they handle victory and how do they handle losses? Do they focus on the team or the players? Are they willing to discipline players if it hurts the team, talent-wise?
</p><p>
It will include hall of fame players. There are three particular players that were pureblood Ravens in the Hall of Fame. Biographies and pictures of each will be included as they are absolutely cultural anchors for the team.
</p><p>
The superbowl years will get their own section as it is the crowning achievement for a team. They did that in 2001 versus the Giants and 2013 versus the 49ers. 2013 was the infamous ‘power outage’ bowl where the stadium went dark during the game.

      </ul>
      <h3>Team Outlook</h3>
      <p>
        The last page will be dedicated to the future of the Ravens. Next season's schedule and the most prominent members of the team that the franchise will hold on to until retirement. These will be the current stars that are expected to remain Ravens in the foreseeable future. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It will feature a schedule for next season as it is updated leading up to the season. This far from the next season will likely just have opponents and home/road games and not actual times. The date of the season opener will be included until the season has begun.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will have a biography of the face of the team, Lamar Jackson, and picture. The head coach will be featured, with a biography and picture. A list of team captains will be featured, there are several so probably won’t try and add pictures/biographies but am open to doing so if more content is needed.
