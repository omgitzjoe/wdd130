                <h1>De'Andre Hopkins Joins Ravens</h1>
                <p>
                    Veteran talent is joining the Raven's recievers. Pro-bowler De'Andre Hopkins is here to
                    improve the Ravens' chances of going to the Superbowl. The signing is for one year and will cost
                    6 million dollars, he is worth every penny!

                    Raven's cut Marcus Williams
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The Ravens have decided to let their veteran safety go. The move was a strategic way to save on 
                    salary cap. Can't keep them all and the Raven's will be persuing a more frugal approach to the position.
                    The Ravens benched him mid-season and this releasing was expected.

                <h1>Ravens re-sign Ronnie Stanley</h1>
                <p>
                    This was a huge win for the ravens as Ronnie Stanley was very sought after.
                    Left Tackle is such a crucial position and we managed to retain our star for a very
                    reasonable deal. At 20 million a season, the Ravens made the necessary adjustments to
                    hold onto this key piece to our SuperBowl dreams!

                This website is designed to attract Baltimore Ravens fans, both the veterans, and the newcomers. People will want to come to this site to see news updates about the football team, current standings, and very brief descriptions of prominent members of the team. Page one will be a current event type page, page two being a historical page, and page three being a future forecast for the team. Page one will be the most visually pleasing page as it is partly the hook to bring in and keep visitors. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Recent signings, scandals, trade rumours. All will be easily available here on the home page, for easy access. 
                Injury news or disciplinary action as well, to help out your fantasy sports team on who or whom not to play. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I intend to have a power rankings chart when closer to the season and one becomes available from espn.com or nfl.com. For now I will have a link to the website's final 2024 season rankings. https://www.espn.com/nfl/fpi and https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-power-rankings-super-bowl-2024-nfl-season 
                The site will have a preview to the next game which will have who, when, and where it will be playing.
