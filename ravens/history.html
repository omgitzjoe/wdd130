            <h1>Our greatness</h1>
            <p>
                This is what makes the Ravens, the Ravens. We hit hard, don't back down, and don't accept mediocre
                as good enough. We have tradition of winning with defense and have maintained an elite defense 
                that has spanned decades and includes Hall of Fame players.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our management is perhaps our greatest skill. We draft the best players because we know how to
                scout the best players. We attract the best players because at Baltimore, there always is a shot at
                a SuperBowl.
